LoRa sensor with RAK3172 for temperature, humidity, battery Level and light.

This project proposes the development of an electronic device for real-time data transmission through LoRa (Long Range). This work provides a system capable of monitoring and transmitting data on humidity, temperature, brightness level and battery for periodic control in a given ecosystem.
Firstly, the system allows to remotely monitor the environmental parameters of an ecosystem in order to act on it for different purposes. Secondly, the device consists of a RAK 3172 controller based on a STM32WLE5CC chip which is able to transmit and receive data through the LoRa network. 
For the achievement of this project we will start with an exhaustive study of the available technologies, followed by the design and fabrication of the motherboard, and ending with the programming and implementation of a working prototype.

The hole project has different folders:
1-Programming codes
2-Kicad files for the PCB building (in my case wit JLCPCB)
3-3D printed box for the final PCB
4-PDF document with the hole project where you can follow the project entirely.
